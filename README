Marla - The Websites of Aaron Faanes

Marla contains the web configuration and content for each of my websites. Each
website can be found under its directory, with the following organization:

example.com/            Root for this website
example.com/LICENSE     Root for this website
example.com/httpd/      Apache configuration
example.com/static/     Static content: css, js, etc.
example.com/mason/      Mason component directory

This organization will be created automatically by bin/make-site. You should use
that command when starting from scratch. make-site should construct a relatively
complete framework for a new site. Marla will indicate if any manual
intervention is required.

While Marla intends to be a mostly-automated tool for creating and deploying
websites, I haven't intended it to be used outside my own setup. As a result,
any intrepid people who wish to steal it are welcome to do so, but do so at
their own risk.

Each website will be built using make and installed using make install.
Installation via RPM is also supported. By convention, each website will become
a new subpackage of marla, such as marla-example-com.
