These are testing certificates and private keys. They won't pass any sort of
validation, but they're useful to ensure SSL is working during local
development.

The CA certificate is used to generate new certificates, but it should never be
trusted outside of local development.  The CA key password is 'dummycert'.

NEVER place real certificates here. Real certificates should always be handled
manually by the user, to ensure proper care and handling.
